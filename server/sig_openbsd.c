/* OpenBSD has no way to signal a given thread on a different process. send_thread_signal() signals

 * to the target thread. To tell which thread is the target, the server stores the Unix tid of
 * the target in an array that is shared with the process. It is stored in the file `sig-{pid}`
 * of the server directory, where {pid} is Windows process id.
 *
 * Entry 0 is special - anything in it will forward to all threads - basically an overflow flag
 * Entry 1-64 hold tid's of the pending targets. 0 - free slot.
 *
 * Has to match froward_thread_signal() in ntdll half of the implementation
